# Seattle301d61 Final Project Team #3

## Description / Overview  
The idea behind this application is to allow a user to quickly search for free images based on a keyword or random button. Then the user can save favorites to collection and further save them into a project folders. The user will also be allowed to update the details of an image, and also remove them from their collection. This application will be using a PostgresSQL database, and deployed through heroku.
